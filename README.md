# fanucdir

(intelliJ IDEA javafx desktop project)

## First prototype
- ~~parse a directory~~
- ~~get all the files~~
- ~~parse all them as string~~
- ~~create an object with name program (the first comment of the program), and the file name~~
- ~~be able to search for a name program, getting the matches~~

- ~~change name~~ **NO**
- load/copy to another folder
- create config file and read it at start
- ~~css style~~
- get free program name
- load to cnc_programs folder from external, changing automatically the name
- il progesso di load and save deve essere seamless senza pensare al nome del file, lo deve fare in automatico
